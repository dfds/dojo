Ideas:
- deploy claim with some fields
- change claim fields
- change the XRD schema and watch for sync status
- understand the composition and effects of changing it
- understand the term platform operator vs consumer
- building composite resources could be to absract the underlyaing vendor details (we don't know if it 's AWS or Azure) or to add additional fields and policies on top of it, it like you have super sets , and you don't have to spend time on how to put together the lego bricks
