DFDS Crossplane - Code kata #6
======================================

This training exercise is an **intermediate-level** course on Crossplane that serves as a starting point for SRE's looking to install and maintain Crossplane at DFDS.

## Getting started
These instructions will help you prepare for the kata and ensure that your training machine has the tools installed you will need to complete the assignment(s). If you find yourself in a situation where one of more tools might not be available for your training environment please reach out to your instructor for assistance on how to proceed, post an [issue in our repository](https://github.com/dfds/dojo/issues) or fix it yourself and update the kata via a [pull request](https://github.com/dfds/dojo/pulls).

### Prerequisites
* Kubernetes Cluster
* Kubectl
* Helm

## Exercise
Your sixth assignment will see you deploy resources using custom compositions and claims

### 1. Create an instance.yaml

First we can deploy an instance of our new composite resource.

Create an instance.yaml with the following contents:

```
apiVersion: crossplane.dfds.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: CompositeDatabaseInstance
metadata:
  # Composite resources are cluster scoped, so there's no need for a namespace.
  name: my-composite-database-instance
spec:
  parameters:
    region: eu-west-1
    dbInstanceClass: db.t3.small
    masterUsername: masteruser
    allocatedStorage: 20
    engine: postgres
    engineVersion: "13"
    skipFinalSnapshotBeforeDeletion: true
  compositionRef:
    name: compositedatabaseinstances.crossplane.dfds.cloud
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    namespace: default
    name: my-composite-database-credentials
```

### 2. Apply the instance manifest

Next we will apply the manifest

```
kubectl apply -f instance.yaml
```

### 3. Verify deployment

Verify the deployment by issuing a get and describe

```
kubectl get compositedatabaseinstance
kubectl describe compositedatabaseinstance
kubectl get securitygroup
kubectl get rdsinstance
```

It could take 5 minutes for the deployment to complete

### 4. Create a static.yaml

Now let's make a static claim to the resource we just created. A static claim will take sole ownership of the resource

```
apiVersion: crossplane.dfds.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: DatabaseInstance
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: my-static-claim
spec:
  parameters:
    region: eu-west-1
    dbInstanceClass: db.t3.small
    masterUsername: masteruser
    allocatedStorage: 20
    engine: postgres
    engineVersion: "13"
    skipFinalSnapshotBeforeDeletion: true
  resourceRef:
    apiVersion: crossplane.dfds.cloud/v1alpha1
    kind: CompositeDatabaseInstance
    name: my-composite-database-instance
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: my-static-database-creds
```

### 4. Apply the static manifest

Now apply the manifest to deploy the claim

```
kubectl apply -f static.yaml
```

### 5. Verify there is now a static databaseinstance and secret in your namespace

Observe the status of the database instance. Note how it is scoped to the namespace and that a secret also exists

```
kubectl get databaseinstance -n my-namespace
kubectl get secret -n my-namespace
```

### 5. Create a dynamic.yaml

Next we will create a dynamic claim. This should provision an instance dynamically on request from the claim

```
apiVersion: crossplane.dfds.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: DatabaseInstance
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: my-dynamic-claim
spec:
  parameters:
    region: eu-west-1
    dbInstanceClass: db.t3.small
    masterUsername: masteruser
    allocatedStorage: 30
    engine: postgres
    engineVersion: "13"
    skipFinalSnapshotBeforeDeletion: true
  compositionSelector:
    matchLabels:
      purpose: database
      provider: aws
  
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: my-dynamic-claim-secret
```

### 6. Apply the dynamic manifest

Now apply the dynamic claim

```
kubectl apply -f dynamic.yaml
```

This should take about 5 minutes

### 7. Verify dynamic databaseinstance, secret and resource creation
```
kubectl get databaseinstance -n my-namespace
kubectl get securitygroup
kubectl get rdsinstance
```

Once the rds instance has finished creating, and the databaseinstance detects this and shows as Ready (this could take a few minutes), 
we should see the secret appear in our namespace

```
kubectl get secret -n my-namespace
```

### 8. Cleanup resources

We need to clean up our resources so that we do not incur unnecessary costs in our cloud account

```
kubectl delete -f static.yaml
kubectl delete -f dynamic.yaml

```

We should also cleanup Kata 5 definitions if we are continuing to Kata 7 so that they do not conflict with the package we create

```
kubectl delete -f composition.yaml
kubectl delete -f definition.yaml
```
